- Checking if the distance between the one who reload and others players are <= 512 units ;
- If so, sending a ReloadSound message to the concerned players.
About ReloadSound message :
- arg 1 : probably the sound volume based on the distance. (decompiled code gives : (1.0 - distance * 0.001953125) * 255.0) & 0xFF )
- arg 2 : 0 if the weapons are either m3 or xm1014, 1 otherwise.
